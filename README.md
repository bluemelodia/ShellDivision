2-player game where your goal is to survive to the modern era as the dominant species
Gameplay takes place on a small grid, where you can lay down one organism per turn (5 turns = 1 era)
Organism can be placed pretty much anywhere that's habitable
If you can completely surround an opposing piece with your pieces, all of the opposing pieces will die (outcompeted), this includes invasive and competing species but not predators
Game will end if one of the 2 players die, or when there are no spaces left on the grid
How to win: survive to the modern era with more organisms on the board than your rival, you become the dominant species 

Organism 
Newest organisms are eggs, they can be killed by pretty much anything
Survive 1 turn = infant, small % chance of defending against preddator
Survive 2 turns = juveniles, some % chance of defending against predator
Survive 3 turns = adult, immune to bird, crab, and racoon predation, moderate chance of defending against the remaining predators, also less vulnerable to diseases and habitat-altering disasters

Environment
There are four zones in the beginning: grasslands, desert, beach, and ocean
The terrain will stay the same, but certain areas may become inhabitable due to random events

Time Periods
These will just give you a good idea of how close you are to the end of the game, but besides the extinction events there will be no guarantee of scientific accuracy
Upper Jurassic
Lower Cretaceous
Upper Cretaceous - guaranteed massive extinction event (bye bye dinosaurs)
Paleocene
Eocene
Oligocene
Miocene
Pliocene
Pleistocene
Holocene - guaranteed massive extinction event (humans)

Events
1) Mass exinction, which will trigger randomly, but at most once every three eras - a high percentage of organisms on the board wiped out
  Possibilities: supervolcano, meteorite impact, ice age, alien invasion
    Alien invasion will WIPE THE ENTIRE BOARD!
2) Disaster, which may affect anywhere from one to all terrains
  a) Famine - organisms take 2x the time to mature into adults 
  b) Disease - organisms in a certain age bracket have higher mortality 
  c) Competition - a third species will appear to compete with the players and stay for some period of time
  d) Invasive Species - an invasive species starts taking over one of the terrain areas, will last for maximum 3 eras
  e) Predation - birds (teleport), crabs/racoons (moves to adjacent spaces only, and only vertically or horizontally), and sharks/crocodiles (swim in any direction, the latter will hunt turtles on land) appear and start to move around the grid randomly, eating any organisms that they encounter
  f) Habitat-altering disasters such as algal blooms/oil spills (ocean), litter (beach), rendering certain portions of the board temporarily uninhabitable
  g) Geographical barriers - these can arise randomly, but at most once every 10 eras, which will kill any organisms that were on the squares where the barrier arises, they will dissipate after 10 eras
  
Species - if I get to this part, it's cause everything else was done
Snapping turtle
  Advantage: 100% immune to predation upon reaching adulthood
  Disadvantage: all age brackets take on the highest possible disease mortality
Sea turtle
  Advantage: can mature in 3 turns instead of 4
  Disadvantage: confined to the beach and ocean habitats
Galapagos tortoise
  Advantage: can convert invasive species into their own kind the invader is surrounded by 3 tortoises
  Disadvantage: competitors can kill this tortoise by surrounding them with 3 of their members only 
Softshell turtle
  Advantage: not affected by algal blooms, oil spills, and litter, can convert them into pristine habitat by being adjacent to it
  Disadvantage: 25% lower chance of defending against all predators
Cocurtle 
  Advantage: they will not die when surrounded
  Disadvantage: takes 4x the time to mature to adults during famines

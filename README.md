# Testudo
2-player game where your goal is to survive to the modern era as the dominant species
Gameplay takes place on a small grid, where you can lay down one organism per turn (5 turns = 1 era)
If you can completely surround an opposing piece with your pieces, all of the opposing pieces will die (outcompeted)

Organism 
The organisms that you just laid down are considered infants, they are the most vulnerable to adverse events
Organisms that have survived for two turns are juveniles, they are moderately resistant to adverse events
Organisms that survived three turns are adults, they are immune to certain types of adverse events

Environment
There are three zones in the beginning: grasslands, desert, beach, and ocean
The terrain will stay the same, but certain areas may become inhabitable due to random events

Events
1) Mass exinction, which will trigger randomly, but at most once every three eras - a high percentage of organisms on the board wiped out
  Possibilities: supervolcano, meteorite impact, ice age, alien invasion
2) Disaster, which may affect anywhere from one to all terrains
  a) Famine - organisms take 2x the time to mature into adults 
  b) Disease - organisms in a certain age bracket have higher mortality 
  c) Competition - a third species will appear to compete with the players and stay for some period of time
  d) Invasive Species - an invasive species appears to take up precious space
  e) Predation - birds or crabs appear and start to move around the grid randomly, eating any organisms that they encounter
  f) Habitat-altering disasters such as algal blooms/oil spills (ocean), litter (beach),  - renders certain portions of the board temporarily uninhabitable 
  
3) Special traits, which affects individuals
  
2) Disaster, which will trigger randomly, but at most once per era, and they will only affect one terrain type
  Possibilities: earthquake, flood, famine, volcano
  Everything in that terrain could possibly be wiped out!
3) Deadly 

Cell game with random events 
Goal is colonize the board with the max number of cells - 2 player game 
Extinction event - antibiotics, new mutant strain, overcrowding
